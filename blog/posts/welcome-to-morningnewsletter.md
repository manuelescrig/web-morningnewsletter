Hi, I'm Manuel Escrig. I'm a software developer, and like many of you, I start every morning drowning in information.

## Why I Built This

Every morning, I found myself doing the same exhausting routine: checking my email, then Slack, then crypto prices, then the weather, then tech news, then my business metrics. By the time I'd gathered all the information I needed to start my day, I'd already spent 45 minutes jumping between apps, lost my focus, and felt overwhelmed before I'd even had my coffee.

I kept thinking: there has to be a better way.

As a developer, I've always believed technology should make our lives simpler, not more complicated. Yet here I was, using dozens of "productivity" apps that were actually making me less productive. I wanted one place, one email, one moment of clarity each morning that would tell me everything I needed to know.

So I built it.

## The Vision

MorningNewsletter isn't just another app to add to your morning routine. It's designed to replace the chaos with calm, the scattered with the structured. When you wake up, there's one beautiful email waiting for you with everything that matters to your day.

## Why This Matters to Me

This project is deeply personal. As someone who's spent years optimizing code and building systems, I couldn't stand the inefficiency of my own mornings. But more than that, I care about the human side of technology. We shouldn't have to adapt to our tools; they should adapt to us.

Every feature in MorningNewsletter comes from a real need I experienced:
- The customizable delivery time? Because I wanted my brief ready when I woke up, not when some algorithm decided.
- The source flexibility? Because my interests and responsibilities change, and my tools should keep up.
- The clean, scannable format? Because information should clarify, not clutter.

## The Power of AI in Your Morning

What excites me most is how AI transforms this experience. We're not just aggregating data; we're using AI to:

**Summarize the noise**: Instead of reading 20 news articles, you get the essential insights that actually matter to your work and interests.

**Make it listenable**: Sometimes you want to absorb your morning brief while making breakfast or during your commute. AI helps us convert your personalized brief into natural, listenable audio.

**Understand context**: The AI learns what's important to you, highlighting significant changes in your metrics or unusual patterns in your data.

**Connect the dots**: When your crypto portfolio shifts and there's related news, or when weather might impact your business metrics, AI helps surface these connections.

## This Is Just the Beginning

I believe in building in public and with my users. MorningNewsletter will grow and evolve based on what you need. I read every piece of feedback, because this isn't just my tool anymore; it's ours.

Some things I'm excited to explore:
- Voice assistants that can read your brief and answer questions about it
- Smart notifications for truly urgent updates during the day
- Team briefings for companies and organizations
- Integration with even more data sources you rely on
