Hi, I'm **Manuel Escrig**. I'm a software developer, and like many of you, I start every morning drowning in information.

## Why I Built This

Every morning, I found myself trapped in the same exhausting routine:

1. Check email
2. Open Slack
3. Check crypto prices
4. Look at the weather
5. Browse tech news
6. Review business metrics
7. ...and on and on

By the time I'd gathered all the information I needed to start my day, I'd already spent **45 minutes** jumping between apps, lost my focus, and felt overwhelmed before I'd even had my coffee.

### The Breaking Point

I kept thinking: *there has to be a better way.*

As a developer, I've always believed technology should make our lives simpler, not more complicated. Yet here I was, using dozens of "productivity" apps that were actually making me **less** productive. 

### The Solution

I wanted:
- **One place** for all my morning information
- **One email** that I could read in minutes
- **One moment** of clarity to start my day

So I built it.

## The Vision

MorningNewsletter isn't just another app to add to your morning routine. It's designed to replace the chaos with calm, the scattered with the structured. When you wake up, there's one beautiful email waiting for you with everything that matters to your day.

## Why This Matters to Me

This project is deeply personal. As someone who's spent years optimizing code and building systems, I couldn't stand the inefficiency of my own mornings. But more than that, I care about the human side of technology. We shouldn't have to adapt to our tools; they should adapt to us.

Every feature in MorningNewsletter comes from a real need I experienced:

- The customizable delivery time? Because I wanted my brief ready when I woke up, not when some algorithm decided.
- The source flexibility? Because my interests and responsibilities change, and my tools should keep up.
- The clean, scannable format? Because information should clarify, not clutter.

## The Power of AI in Your Morning

What excites me most is how AI transforms this experience. We're not just aggregating data; we're using AI to create something truly intelligent.

### AI-Powered Features ðŸ¤–

#### **Summarize the Noise**
Instead of reading 20 news articles, you get the essential insights that actually matter to your work and interests. Our AI:
- Analyzes hundreds of sources
- Extracts key information
- Presents only what's relevant to you

#### **Make it Listenable**
Sometimes you want to absorb your morning brief while making breakfast or during your commute. AI helps us:
- Convert your brief into natural speech
- Optimize for easy listening
- Let you start your day hands-free

#### **Understand Context**
The AI learns what's important to you:
- Highlights significant changes in your metrics
- Identifies unusual patterns in your data
- Adapts to your interests over time

#### **Connect the Dots**
Our AI finds connections humans might miss:
- Links crypto movements to relevant news
- Correlates weather with business impact

## This Is Just the Beginning

I believe in building in public and with my users. MorningNewsletter will grow and evolve based on what you need. I read every piece of feedback, because this isn't just my tool anymore; it's ours.

Some things I'm excited to explore:

- Voice assistants that can read your brief and answer questions about it
- Smart notifications for truly urgent updates during the day
- Team briefings for companies and organizations
- Integration with even more data sources you rely on
